This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Please see the build and startup instructions at their repo.

This project allows you to include two types of iOS-style switches on your site using [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org) or greater.

To begin, import this package as `Switches` or any name you choose. The examples below assume the package name, “Switches.”

```
import * as Switches from 'boolean_switches';
```

You can then use `Switches` as a name space for the two kinds of switches this package provides.

<h2>Two-State Boolean Switches</h2>

This type of switch simply has an on/off state.
